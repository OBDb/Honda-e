    description: "The Honda e is the brand's first purpose-built electric vehicle for the European and Japanese markets, featuring a distinctive retro-futuristic design that combines classic Honda styling elements with modern technology. Built on a dedicated EV platform with a rear-motor, rear-wheel-drive configuration unusual for its class, it emphasizes driving dynamics and urban maneuverability with a turning circle of just 4.3 meters. The exterior design is characterized by its round LED headlights and taillights, flush door handles, and camera mirrors that replace traditional side mirrors—all contributing to its unique aesthetic and improved aerodynamics. Available with either a 35.5 kWh battery paired with a 134 HP electric motor or a higher-output 152 HP version in the Advance grade, it offers a modest WLTP range of approximately 220 km (137 miles)—deliberately optimized for urban use rather than long-distance travel. The interior represents one of the most distinctive aspects of the vehicle, featuring a full-width digital dashboard comprising five screens: two 12.3-inch touchscreens in the center, two 6-inch displays for the side camera mirrors, and a digital instrument cluster. Materials and design emphasize a lounge-like atmosphere with fabric upholstery and wood-effect trim. Charging capabilities include AC charging up to 6.6 kW and DC fast charging up to 100 kW, allowing an 80% charge in around 30 minutes. The Honda e has received critical acclaim for its design, technology, and driving experience, though its limited range and relatively high price have restricted its market appeal. Rather than aiming for mass-market success, the Honda e serves as a technology showcase and brand statement, representing Honda's design-led approach to urban electric mobility as the company transitions toward electrification."
